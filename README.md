- 👋 Hi, I’m Nekonikosaka, living in Tokyo now (my heart remains in Osaka though!)
- 👀 I’m working in tourism field but I always had an interest in programming since my chilhood.
Do you even know Amstrad Basic? (yeah I feel old now...)
Activity is pretty low now in tourism so it's time to work on an old dream!
I also love video games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java & Python
- 💞️ I would love to help my friends' activity and developp appli for them.

...and that profile description needs to be improved but you have the main idea about myself.
